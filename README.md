Compile the Markdown files, then watch for changes and recompile as needed.

make render
make watch
make publish
```

# Tasks

- [ ] implement Reference-URL in the template and atom feed (2012-02-02)
- [ ] ensure the images are shown within the width of the blog (also check if it looks usable on mobile)
- [ ] add a mastodon link
- [ ] remove posts which no longer add any value
- [ ] migrate the comments from disqus to either another platform or include them in the static version and stop having comments altogether. (eg. use Mastodon for comments instead)
