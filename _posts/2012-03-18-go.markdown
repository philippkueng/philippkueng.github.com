[Go](http://golang.org/) is a new programming language and sort of a mixture of C, Python, Oberon and other languages. It tries to solve many problems where other languages are failing when deployed on a very large scale, eg. on Googles infrastructure.

Below are the recordings of last week's joint event by the [IT geeks Zurich](http://www.meetup.com/zh-geeks/events/47295912/) and [GTUG Zurich](http://zurich.gtugs.org/events/go-march-2012). At this event Luuk van Dijk a staff software engineer at Google who's currently working on the Go compiler and [Johan Euphrosine](http://twitter.com/proppy) a Developer Programs Engineer working on [App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) offered some insights on how Go can be leveraged and what it does internally to do so.

Also many thanks to the organizer [Muharem Hrnjadovic](http://twitter.com/al_maisan) for making this second amazing IT geeks event possible.

And without further ado, enjoy the talks below and excuse the Pizza distribution dilemma we luckily had to deal with.
