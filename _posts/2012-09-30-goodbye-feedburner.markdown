During the last couple of weeks many have announced that they are moving away from [Google Feedburner](http://feedburner.com).  The reason for this move, the [Feedburner API](https://developers.google.com/feedburner/) will be shut down in October of this year, probably leading to a similar fate for the feed proxy parts serving this feed.

That means, if you are reading this and would like to do so in a couple of months then I encourage you to update the URL in your feed reader with [http://philippkueng.ch/atom.xml](http://philippkueng.ch/atom.xml).

Thanks guys, for being such great readers.
