<p>Hi users of blogengine. I'd like to announce another minor update to the <a href="http://4squarebewidget.codeplex.com/releases/view/43399" title="foursquare blogengine.net widget">foursquare widget</a> for your favourite blogging platform which can be downloaded from <a href="http://4squarebewidget.codeplex.com/releases/view/43399" title="foursquare blogengine.net widget">codeplex</a>. 
By the way this will be the last release working with the feeds, the next release will be running with the foursquare API.</p>
<p><strong>out-of-the-box usage</strong><br />Now everyone is able to use the plugin with your out-of-the-box BE installation, because I've changed the parts which were using LINQ to use .NET 2.0 methods.
So there's no need to change the framework version to 3.5 anymore...</p>
<p><strong>W3C compliant</strong><br />The other thing I'd like to announce is that the widget is now fully W3C compliant, like BE itself.</p>
<p><strong>Icons are back</strong><br />Last I want to mention that the icons are getting embedded again, because they disappeared in some browsers while displayed via css.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong><br />
    You probably have to reset the blogengine application after you've uploaded the widget to your hosting provider.
    Sorry for that.</p>
