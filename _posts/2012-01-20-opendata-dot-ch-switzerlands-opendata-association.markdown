Yesterday, on january 19th, Swiss OpenData enthusiasts and activists have [founded the OpenData.ch Association in Bern](http://opendata.ch/2012/01/verein-opendata-ch-offiziell-gegrundet-manifest-und-agenda-2012/). It's goal is to bring together citizens, journalists, designers and developers to realize ideas based on publicly available [OpenData](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opendata) and OpenGovernmentData.

More about the goals and mindset of OpenData.ch can be found in the [German-Only - Open Government Data for Switzerland Manifesto](http://opendata.ch/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/OGD-Manifest-Schweiz-1.0.pdf).

If you're up to create something with OD, whether your a developer or not, reserve march 30th and 31st when the next [Make.opendata.ch-Hackathon](http://www.makeopendata.ch/) will be held. Need, some inspiration of what the first one was like? Checkout the [great summary by datavisualization.ch](http://datavisualization.ch/events/review-of-switzerlands-first-open-data-camp/) or read [my hackathon review](http://philippkueng.ch/makeopendatach-2011.html).

Thrilled to start this new chapter with an amazingly diversified group of people.
