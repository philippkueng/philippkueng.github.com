<p>After writing the last post about the <a href="http://philippkueng.ch/post/Blame-the-Lizard-Brain-But-do-it!.aspx">Lizard Brain</a> I gave myself another episode of <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> it was <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/4">episode number 4</a>, and in there, at the end, Marlin Mann talks about the way he is handling Task Lists which mysteriously worked extremely well for me too.</p>

<p>It works as folling, prior to adding a task to your list go mentally through it and notice every single subtask you need to achieve in order to check that item of your list. That way I accomplished 4 tasks which consumed about 2h of my time without really noticing it and that said those tasks were sitting on my list for 3 weeks already.</p>

<p>Next there is the second and last rule, do not dare to put tasks on your list you know upfront you are not going to do anyway. For me such a thing is sorting my photo library, I used to have an entry for sorting pictures taken while being in Canada (2008) on the list until very recently. By the way decluttering it regularly helps a lot too, believe me.</p>
