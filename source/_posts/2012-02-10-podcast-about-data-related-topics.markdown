[OpenData](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), [BigData](Big_data),  Infographics, [Visualizations](http://datavisualization.ch/) and [Data journalism](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/28/data-journalism) are all buzz words and movements which started to get quite some traction lately.

While there are lively ecosystems of blogs around niche topics like visualizations, processing or data journalism there's not enough interdisciplinary communication going on in my opinion. 

Well, how about creating it by interviewing those experts, give them some airtime and maybe even connect previously unknown scientists, journalists, hackers, politicians and ideators to each other.

Since i'm still playing with the idea there's nothing fixed just yet. Language might be english or german depending on who's in front of the camera. Also if you're interested in being a host or you're having a name suggestion let me know.

Would you listen to or watch it?
