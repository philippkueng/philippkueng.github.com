<p>In an effort to make the world a better place, hackers all around Switzerland joined this years make.opendata.ch hackathon in Zürich and Lausanne. The goal was to use publicly available data, so-called <strong>OpenData</strong> and visualize it in a meaningful way so everyone is able to make sense of it.</p>

<p>Despite of having a french language deficit - it was a dark chapter in grammar school - i travelled all the way to EPF Lausanne which was absolutely worth it.</p>

<p>After the kickoff <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/florin_iorganda">Florin</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/FredericJacobs">Frederic</a> and I immediately started working on a project to improve the routes suggestion of traditional mapping applications such as Google Maps and OpenStreetMap by providing a way to add obstacles to a map and then calculate a new obstacle-free route to help people on tight schedules arrive on time. While we knew that large companies are working on that we were still looking for a hack to finish something usable until the deadline the day after.</p>

<p><strong>The theoretical solution</strong> - The frontend would be a static website where the user can enter departure and destination location. This then would make an API call to the backend where the hacks are doing its&#8217; part.
The backend would consist of a webkit process running, controlled by PhantomJS. If a request gets issued PhantomJS loads Google Maps Directions with the start and end location, let the server-side webkit process render the page and then add all the obstacles via Lat/Long with a predefined icon which is easily distinguishable from the map itself. Next, PhantomJS creates a PNG-screenshot of the obstacles and route containing website. It starts the next process which parses the PNG pixel-by-pixel and looks if there is a blue line and an obstacle crossing. If so, make a circle of 300m radius around the obstacle and randomly add a Lat/Long coordinate, being part of the circle border, as a waypoint to the routes call of Google Maps. Then repeat the process above to check if the new route interferes with obstacles. If finally and obstacle-free route is found, return the details to the frontend.</p>

<p>During dinner, about three hours in, we came to the conclusion that it is just too much of a hack to spend valuable hacking time on, so we had to find something more suitable for the next day. Which we did in SwissMap.</p>

<p>Full of vim and vigor we then started on Saturday morning, Florin by collecting the interesting data from all over the <a href="http://www.bfs.admin.ch/">bfs website</a>, Frederic by merging and crunching the data into a format which is then processable via Javascript and I took care of the view and the comparing alogrithm. We aimed at building a web application where citizens and data-journalists can compare two different, unrelated datasets and visualize the outcome on a swiss heatmap. Luckily our very intense and focused hacking on day two was enough so that we were able to meet the presentation deadline in the afternoon. Epic Win.</p>
