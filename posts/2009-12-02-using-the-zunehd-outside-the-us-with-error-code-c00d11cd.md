    my ZuneHD was delivered straight from the US. But unfortunately I wasn’t able to sync it with my computer (German
    Windows 7). After some research I stumbled upon this <a

        first sync)</a> which gave which gave me the solution.</p>
<p>My ZuneHD was shipped with firmware 4.0 which only support English, Spanish and French Windows language. To upgrade
    it you will either have to use an <strong>Windows XP / Vista / Windows 7 with English OS language</strong> or
    download and install the <strong>English Language Pack</strong> (I haven’t done this, but it was mentioned in the
    forum thread).</p>
<p>After the firmware update is on the device (currently 4.3) you should be able to plug it in any Windows computer no
    matter what the language of the OS is. (if you use the <a
