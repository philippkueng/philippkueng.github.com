<p>At the last&nbsp;<a href="https://techup.ch/98/webtuesday-zurich-lightning-talks">#webtuesday</a>, <a
        href="https://twitter.com/zurcherart">Steve</a> and I had the opportunity to talk about the 2 day Hackathon we
    held during the christmas break. (slides below)</p>
<p>If you want to make a hackday yourself be warned that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Setting up your environment (developer and production server) will take you much longer that you expect at the
        beginning. (took as about half a day)</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that working with new technology (especially if you're doing a hackday to learn something new)
        might be very cumbersome at the beginning.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Apart from the lack of knowledge you might have, there can be some delays trying to implement third party
        libraries (which might contain bugs themselves)</li>
    <li>To keep the team (or just yourself) focused we found it very useful to have a fixed deadline. Sometimes
        accountability might already be sufficient.</li>
    <li>Before you make your newly developed service public make sure you already have a hosting solution that allows
        you to scale if demand suddenly increases, furthermore be knowledgeable about where your data gets stored and
        who can access it. (remove all those "password" passwords at least)</li>
</ul>

        (you'll find the according source on github)</a>.</p>
