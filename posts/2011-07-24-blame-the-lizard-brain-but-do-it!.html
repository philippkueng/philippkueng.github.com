Title: Blame the Lizard Brain. But do it!

<p>Today I was listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> by Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin while coding
    up the next Big Thing, at least that is what the Lizard Brain tells me. During the <a
        href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/1">episode</a> they were talking about excuses one might have for not shipping all
    those unfinished projects.</p>

<p>Among those things standing in the way of letting us succeed with our ambition is the so called Lizard Brain (<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala">Amygdala</a>). According to <a
        href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com">Seth Godin</a> it only cares about four things: food, reproduction, safety
    and of course itself.</p>

<p>So in order to satisfy the Amygdala one has to minimize risk which is not really arrangeable with having a startup or
    generally learning new things because leaving our comfort zone is always a part of making progress.</p>

<p>Like with every other unwanted behaviour applying the <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">principle of classical conditioning</a> to ourselves
    might do the trick. In order proove my theory of Lizard Brain-self-conditioning right or wrong I am planning to work
    with it during the next month, constantly placing myself in unknown or personal flight-situations. </p>

<p>As far as I know it takes about three weeks to get used to something, so the last week should then be pure
    productivity and joy without procrastination and anxiety. I will let you know if it worked out until then wish me
    luck. (for the last part, that was clearly the Amygdala speaking ;-)</p>
