<p>Last night I had the task to fix a clients custom built website which I wrote quite a while ago on top of an early
    version of <a href="https://github.com/philippkueng/hammyoncoffeine">hammyoncoffeine</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing difficult you might think, in the end I should be familiar with it, additionally I was using Version Control
    which
    were even better preconditions. So I thought.</p>

<p>Fact is, the date of the initial commit lies about half a year in the future from the date I actually needed.</p>

<p>Luckily I was playing quite a bit with Backup Tools at that time so going through the zip-archives on Wuala should
    bring the piece of code to daylight.</p>

<p>Sadly I only compressed ready-to-deploy pakets and yes they're are already compiled. So much for that.</p>

<p>In the end I had to apply non-DRY ducktape patches to meet the deadline, nonetheless I learned a valuable lesson that
    night, <strong>commit early and often</strong> (even when working on seemingly unimportant files).</p>
