<p><strong>Notice</strong><br />
    There's a <a href="/2010-04-11-foursquare-blogenginenet-widget-version-03.html">newer release</a>
    available.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/2010/3/foursquare-blogengine-widget-version-0.2.png" alt="Foursquare BlogEngine widget version 0.2" />
<p>During the last week I've added <a href="https://maps.bing.com">Bing Maps</a> to the widget, so that you're last
    check-ins can be displayed on there.</p>
<p><strong>Can I deactivate the map?</strong><br />
    I've assumed that not all of you, would like to show your check-ins on the map aswell, so I've implemented the
    option to turn the map off.</p>
<p><strong>Will the map play nicely with my current theme?</strong><br />
    For everyone with a custom designed theme it sometimes can be frustrating adding another widget because you have to
    alter design settings everytime a new version comes out, to make this part easier, you can now edit the height and
    width settings in the edit section of the foursquare blogengine widget.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find the widget?</strong><br />The <a
        href="https://4squarebewidget.codeplex.com/releases/view/41923">new release</a>, as all the other releases, is
    available at the <a href="https://4squarebewidget.codeplex.com">according codeplex site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong><br />
    With the current version you'll still need to reset the application after you've uploaded the widget. Sorry for
    that.</p>
