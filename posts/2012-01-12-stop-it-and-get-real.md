Right now I've already broken most of my New Years resolutions, I admit it. Why? - Well, I thought of me as a machine, meaning that I could easily deliver one hundred percent without an issue. In fact, that's extremely unlikely to happen and I obviously knew that but I still made that promise with myself, you need to aim high right?. However, the impact it has by breaking resolutions or not reaching your goals makes you feel terrible or worse even makes you feel sorry for yourself. That's why I recommend you watch this excellent talk by Tony Schwartz and start correcting your self expectations by stop wanting to prove yourself to others or yourself. It's good to have goals but a weekly to do list has nothing to do with dreams just doable tasks.
