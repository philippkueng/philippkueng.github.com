Tags: Nikon, DSLR

Ten days back Nikon announced their new flagship model, the [Nikon D4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D4). It's clearly got a higher Megapixel value - as needed for marketing purposes. On the side it has gotten some long awaited features such as proper HD video recording with all the bells and whistles you'd expect. For more details listen to James Banfield below.

The most innovative feature in my perspective however is the Ethernet connection and what comes with it, a camera management console completely built in HTML and JS so one's finally able to leave all the proprietary, heavily bloated, vendor specific crap software behind and focus on realizing ideas.
