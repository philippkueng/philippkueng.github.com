Being a heavy procrastinator myself I agree with [John Perry](http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~jperry//index.html) but I'd like to extend one point. While some work can be encouraging even slightly more can have devastating effects. From my personal experience a task overflow can turn everything into white noise at which stage you're not caring about any of it anymore.

Positive side effect, you're able to work off those items quite relaxed. On the other side you might also over-commit to incoming work because estimating white noise is kind of difficult.

On another note, have a look at the awesome copy in the article footer. Brutally honest.
